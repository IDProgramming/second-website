# second-website
my  second website following the odin project assignments

starting from the header this was an incredibly difficult project for me. finally getting a deeper understanding of flexbox I went to experiment with border colors, border radius, and different levels of flexbox nesting. overall I was hung up and frustrated for entire days until specifically utilizing a bigger flex container to flex two otherwise incompatible containers. however, once confidently completing the template it was fun to stylize the website further with different colors for sections as well as text, links, and the buttons. also, near the end began committing every time.
